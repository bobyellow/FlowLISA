# FlowLISA
The **univariate** local Moran's I for spatial flow data, which was proposed along with the bivariate version, namely **BiFlowLISA** (Tao and Thill, 2020). 

As detailed in Equation (3) (detailed in Tao et al. 2023), $FI_{i,j}$ is the local Moranâ€™s I statistic, or the spatial autocorrelation measure of flow between origin $i$ and destination $j$. $f_{i,j}$ represents the value (or volume) of flow between regions $i$ and $j$. $n$ is the total number of flows in the study area. $\bar{f}$ is the average value of all flows. $w_{ij,uv}$ is the spatial flow weight between $f_{i,j}$ and $f_{u,v}$.

Equation (3):

$$
FI_{(i,j)}
\=\
\frac{
  n\\bigl(f_{(i,j)} - \bar{f}\bigr)\
  \displaystyle\sum_{(u,v)\neq(i,j)} w_{ij,uv}\\bigl(f_{(u,v)} - \bar{f}\bigr)
}{
  \displaystyle\sum_{i,j}^n \\bigl(f_{(i,j)} - \bar{f}\bigr)^2
}
$$
